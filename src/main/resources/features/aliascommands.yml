# AliasCommands Feature
# Define as many alias commands as you want below.
# Each alias will be registered as a real command (tab-complete included).
#
# Format:
#   aliases:
#     <alias>: "<command to execute>"
#
# The <alias> is the command players type (without the slash).
# The <command to execute> is what gets run as the player (without the slash).
# Use %player% as a placeholder for the player's name if needed.
#
# Example:
#   afk: "warp afk"
#   spawn: "warp spawn"
#   hub: "server hub"

aliases:
  afk: "warp afk"
